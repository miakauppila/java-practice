## Enum and Iterator

- The iterator is created by requesting it from a specified list - in this case a list containing persons. 
- The iterator always points to a particular object inside the list.
- Methods:
    - `hasNext()` method is used to ask if there are any objects still to be iterated over.
    - `next()` method can be used to request the next object in line from the iterator.
    - `remove()` method removes from the list the item returned by the iterator with the previous next call.
